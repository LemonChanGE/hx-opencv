Haxe-c++ bindings for OpenCV (C API) version 2.3.1 (latest Debian testing version)

This is incredibly early alpha I suppose, I am not at this time intending myself to fully
support the entirety of the C API, and the API that is supported will not have been
thoroughly tested if at all.

Anyone wishing to use OpenCV in hxcpp should consider testing and submitting pull requests :)
