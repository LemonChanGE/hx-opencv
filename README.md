Haxe-c++ bindings for OpenCV (C API)

Built against OpenCV 2.4.4 (built from source) with QT 4.8.2 and OpenGL on Linux64.

This is incredibly early alpha I suppose, I am not at this time intending myself to fully
support the entirety of the C API, and the API that is supported will not have been
thoroughly tested if at all.

Anyone wishing to use OpenCV in hxcpp should consider testing and submitting pull requests :)
